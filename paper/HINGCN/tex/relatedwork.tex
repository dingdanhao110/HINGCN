Although the two bottlenecks have attracted great attention,
few methods aim to solve both.
In fact, power iteration based methods can
not only reduce the high time complexity,
but also utilize all the relevant eigenvectors rather than just the top-$k$ eigenvectors,
which further leads to a good performance in
data containing multi-scale clusters or much noise.
Recently, without any assumptions, 
FUSE~\cite{ye2016fuse} was proposed 
which has been proved both effective and efficient even on data containing multi-scale clusters.
Its success arises from the fusion of all the cluster-separation information,
but noise is also encoded. Further, based on ICA, it might be trapped into local optimum
and run slowly. These shortcomings motivate us to further explore spectral clustering.
