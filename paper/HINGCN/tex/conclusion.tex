\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we studied the effectiveness of semi-supervised classification methods in handling heterogeneous information network data.

Future work: in this paper we propose to use hand-crafted edge features to enhance missing information in the shrinking homogeneous graph. One possible approach would be automatic learning of edge features to provide an end-to-end solution to heterogeneous graph embedding problems.
